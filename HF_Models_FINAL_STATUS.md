## üîß Covariate Integration Pattern (Consistent Across All Models)

### Standard Implementation:
```python
# Add temporal embedding for covariates
from layers.Embed import TemporalEmbedding, TimeFeatureEmbedding

# Choose embedding type based on config
if configs.embed == 'timeF':
    self.temporal_embedding = TimeFeatureEmbedding(
        d_model=self.base_model.d_model, 
        embed_type=configs.embed, 
        freq=configs.freq
    )
else:
    self.temporal_embedding = TemporalEmbedding(d_model=self.base_model.d_model)

# In forward pass:
if x_mark_enc is not None and x_mark_enc.size(-1) > 0:
    enc_temporal_embed = self.temporal_embedding(x_mark_enc)
    # Integrate with input data
    x_enc_enhanced = x_enc + enc_temporal_embed[:, :, :x_enc.size(-1)]
```
