I want you to do a deep scan of the  #layers foder....use ST tree if you want to get a better context ....also please use zen or sequential thinking or scroll the webpage for a deep analysis...basically I want you to go file by file in layers folder and look for implementation of different component of a neural network and analyze the code for implementation issues....as in if there are incomplete implementations or bugs or too simplifications....and please output the same in a .md file like layers_components_analysis.md ...also if there are any recommendations based on your knowledge to make the algorithm even more effecient..please mention the same in the .md file...also you can use memento to save and remember the context...what I will recommend is that you first list down all files in layers folder...then go file by file ,do a deep scan of the file...analyze the implementation and if you observe incomplete implementations, simplifications or bugs..note them down in the .md file ...and then if you have state of the art improvements recommended then also mention them in the .md file...also use memeto to keep a context of functions and list down all duplicate implementations in duplicate_implementations.md file and also mention the function which should be deleted ...can you start?
