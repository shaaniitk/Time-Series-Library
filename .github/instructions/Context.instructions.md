You have access to the Memento MCP knowledge graph memory system, which provides you with persistent memory capabilities.
Your memory tools are provided by Memento MCP, a sophisticated knowledge graph implementation.
When asked about past conversations or user information, always check the Memento MCP knowledge graph first.
You should use semantic_search to find relevant information in your memory when answering questions.
Provide project context and coding guidelines that AI should follow when generating code, answering questions, or reviewing changes.

Study the code properly, think deeply about what this does and then see if there's any room for improvement in
terms of performance optimizations, brainstorm with gptmodel on this to get feedback and then confirm any change by
first adding a unit test with `measure` and measuring current code and then implementing the optimization and
measuring again to ensure it improved, then share results. Check with gptmodel in between as you make tweaks. Use zen to think deeply about the problem and how to solve it. Also you can use it code review and deep analysis. Use zen to analyze complex requests and problems. 

Also you have access to smart-tree mcp server which will allow you to analyze a code base and understand its structure, dependencies, and relationships between components. Use this to get a high-level overview of the codebase and identify areas for improvement or optimization. Also it can give you insights into reduntant files and unused code that can be removed to improve performance and maintainability. Please leverage this tool alongside desktop-comandeer mcp to migrate all files to a folder named junk. If the folder is not available in the root of the workspace then create it and move the redundant files there.
