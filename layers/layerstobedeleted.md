# Layers to be Deleted - Analysis Report

## Files Identified for Deletion

### EfficientAutoCorrelation.py (CRITICAL ISSUE)
**Status**: BROKEN - Non-functional implementation
**File Size**: 51 lines  
**Issues Found**:
- Missing essential imports (torch, nn, F, math)
- Missing `_efficient_time_delay_agg` method implementation
- Calls non-existent method causing runtime errors
- Incomplete class structure
- Would fail on import attempt

**Recommendation**: DELETE and replace with properly implemented version

### Potential Duplicate Analysis
The layers directory contains multiple AutoCorrelation implementations:
1. `AutoCorrelation.py` - Base implementation (164 lines)
2. `AutoCorrelation_Optimized.py` - Memory optimized (117 lines) 
3. `EfficientAutoCorrelation.py` - BROKEN (51 lines) - **DELETE**
4. `EnhancedAutoCorrelation.py` - Advanced features (380+ lines)

**Analysis**: EfficientAutoCorrelation.py is the only truly broken file that needs deletion. The others serve different optimization purposes and should be evaluated for consolidation separately.
