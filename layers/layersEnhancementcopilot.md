### EfficientAutoCorrelation.py âœ… FIXED
**Status**: CRITICAL ISSUE RESOLVED  
**Original Issues**:
- Missing essential imports (torch, nn, F, math)
- Missing `_efficient_time_delay_agg` method implementation
- Incomplete class structure
- Non-functional - would fail on import

**Enhancements Implemented**:
1. **Complete Implementation**: Added all missing imports and methods
2. **Type Hints**: Full typing annotations for better code clarity
3. **Documentation**: Comprehensive docstrings for all methods
4. **Error Handling**: Proper bounds checking and validation
5. **Memory Optimization**: 
   - Gradient checkpointing for large sequences
   - Chunked processing with configurable chunk size
   - Mixed precision support for CUDA
6. **Performance Improvements**:
   - Vectorized operations in time delay aggregation
   - Efficient top-k selection with adaptive bounds
   - Optimized tensor operations with in-place additions
7. **Modularity**: Separated layer wrapper class for better organization

**Key Features Added**:
- `EfficientAutoCorrelation` class with complete functionality
- `EfficientAutoCorrelationLayer` wrapper class
- Configurable parameters (max_seq_len, chunk_size, use_checkpoint)
- Mixed precision support for CUDA devices
- Proper memory management for large sequences

**File Size**: Expanded from 51 broken lines to 180+ functional lines

**Technical Improvements**:
- Used `torch.roll()` for efficient circular shifts
- Implemented adaptive top-k calculation with safety bounds
- Added softmax normalization for correlation weights
- Vectorized aggregation with broadcasting for efficiency
- Proper tensor dimension management and permutations

**Backup**: Original broken file saved as `EfficientAutoCorrelation_broken_backup.py`
