Phase 3C splitting targets: tests/integration/test_end_to_end_workflows.py monolith with multiple workflow task tests (forecasting, imputation, anomaly detection, classification, saving/loading). Plan: split into separate focused files: test_workflow_forecasting.py, test_workflow_imputation.py, test_workflow_anomaly_detection.py, test_workflow_classification.py, test_workflow_persistence.py. Each will generate synthetic data via shared helper module (tests/integration/helpers/workflow_data.py). Reduce epochs to 2-3 for speed; keep @pytest.mark.smoke for forecasting only. Remove in-file class wrapper; use functions + fixtures.
