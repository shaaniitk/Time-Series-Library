Plan steps: (1) Reconfirm constraints and run meta-analysis, (2) Research PyTorch memory APIs, (3) Inspect scripts/train/train_pgat_synthetic.py and dependent components, (4) Implement shared memory logging utility with CPU/GPU awareness, (5) Instrument training pipeline at key checkpoints, (6) Execute sanity run or lightweight test, (7) Analyze log coverage and adjust verbosity, (8) Summarize findings and recommend next actions.
