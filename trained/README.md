# Trained Models Directory

This directory is intended to store trained model artifacts, weights, and outputs.

## Structure

- `models/` - Saved model checkpoints and weights
- `logs/` - Training logs and metrics
- `configs/` - Configuration files used for training runs
- `results/` - Model evaluation results and predictions

## Usage

When training models using the scripts in `scripts/train/`, you can specify this directory as the output location for:

- Model checkpoints
- Training logs
- Evaluation results
- Saved configurations

## Note

This directory is initially empty and will be populated as you train models.
