# üîß Scaling Bug Fixes in Enhanced Autoformer Training Scripts

## üìã **Summary**

Fixed scaling consistency issues in validation/test loss computation across all enhanced Autoformer training scripts. The issue was that model predictions are in scaled space while validation/test ground truth data is unscaled (to avoid data leakage).

## ‚ùå **The Problem**

**Data Loading Behavior** (from `data_provider/data_loader.py`):
- ‚úÖ **Training data**: Target features are scaled using `StandardScaler`
- ‚ùå **Validation/Test data**: Target features are **NOT scaled** (intentionally, to avoid data leakage)

**Original Loss Computation**:
- Model predictions: **SCALED** (trained on scaled data)
- Ground truth: **UNSCALED** (val/test data)
- Result: **Inconsistent loss computation** due to scale mismatch

## ‚úÖ **The Fix**

Scale ground truth data during validation/test to match scaled model predictions.

### **Files Fixed**

1. **`train_enhanced_autoformer.py`**
2. **`train_bayesian_autoformer.py`** 
3. **`train_hierarchical_autoformer.py`**

### **Fix Pattern Applied**

**Before:**
```python
# Validation/Test
pred = outputs.detach().cpu().numpy()  # SCALED
true = batch_y.detach().cpu().numpy()  # UNSCALED
loss = criterion(pred, true)  # MISMATCH!
```

**After:**
```python
# Validation/Test  
pred = outputs.detach().cpu().numpy()  # SCALED
true = batch_y.detach().cpu().numpy()  # UNSCALED

# Scale ground truth to match model predictions
if hasattr(self.val_data, 'target_scaler') and self.val_data.target_scaler is not None:
    true = self.val_data.target_scaler.transform(
        true.reshape(-1, true.shape[-1])
    ).reshape(true.shape)

loss = criterion(pred, true)  # NOW CONSISTENT!
```

## üîç **Technical Details**

### **Root Cause**
The enhanced Autoformer models use the same data loading infrastructure as TimesNet:
- Target features are scaled **only on training data** to avoid data leakage
- Validation/test target features remain **unscaled**
- Models output predictions in **scaled space** (since they were trained on scaled targets)

### **Solution Logic**
During validation/test evaluation:
1. Model predictions are inherently scaled (from training)
2. Ground truth targets are unscaled (from data loader)
3. **Apply target scaler transform to ground truth** before loss/metric computation
4. This ensures both predictions and ground truth are in the **same scaled space**

### **Safeguards**
- Check for scaler existence: `hasattr(self.val_data, 'target_scaler')`
- Graceful fallback if scaler not available
- Maintains original data structure and shapes

## üìä **Impact**

### **Before Fix:**
- ‚ùå Validation/test losses were artificially inflated due to scale mismatch
- ‚ùå Model selection based on inconsistent validation metrics
- ‚ùå Test metrics not comparable to training metrics

### **After Fix:**
- ‚úÖ Consistent scaling across train/val/test
- ‚úÖ Reliable model selection based on proper validation metrics  
- ‚úÖ Comparable and interpretable loss values
- ‚úÖ More accurate performance evaluation

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Notes**

1. **Training loop unchanged**: No scaling issues during training since both inputs and targets are scaled consistently.

2. **Data leakage prevention maintained**: We don't change data loading - still only fit scalers on training data.

3. **Metrics remain valid**: All computed metrics (MAE, MSE, RMSE, MAPE) are now in consistent scaled space.

4. **Backward compatibility**: Changes are isolated to loss computation and don't affect model architecture or data loading.

## üîß **Verification**

All fixed scripts pass syntax compilation:
```bash
‚úÖ python -m py_compile train_enhanced_autoformer.py
‚úÖ python -m py_compile train_bayesian_autoformer.py  
‚úÖ python -m py_compile train_hierarchical_autoformer.py
```

## üìù **Related Issues**

- **Original issue**: Found in `train_financial_timesnet.py` 
- **Status**: TimesNet script intentionally **NOT** modified (as requested)
- **Scope**: Applied same fix pattern to all enhanced Autoformer variants

This fix ensures that all enhanced Autoformer training scripts now have consistent and reliable loss computation across training, validation, and testing phases.
